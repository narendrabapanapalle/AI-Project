Landmark Indian Judgments – Detailed Definitions and Explanations

1. Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) – Basic Structure Doctrine

This landmark Supreme Court case is one of the most significant in
Indian constitutional law. The issue was whether Parliament had
unlimited power to amend the Constitution under Article 368. The
petitioner, Kesavananda Bharati, challenged land reform laws in Kerala
that affected his religious institution’s property.
The Supreme Court, in a 13-judge bench (the largest in its history),
held by a 7–6 majority that while Parliament has wide powers to amend
the Constitution, it cannot alter its “basic structure.” The Court did
not give an exhaustive list but identified elements such as the
supremacy of the Constitution, separation of powers, rule of law,
judicial review, and federalism as part of this doctrine. The judgment
established the principle that Parliament’s amending power is not
absolute, ensuring the Constitution’s core identity remains intact.

2. Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) – Right to Life and Personal Liberty (Article 21)

This case expanded the interpretation of the right to life and personal
liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. Maneka Gandhi’s passport
was impounded by the government “in public interest” without giving her
reasons. She challenged this as a violation of her fundamental rights.
The Supreme Court ruled that Article 21 cannot be interpreted narrowly.
The term “procedure established by law” must be just, fair, and
reasonable, not arbitrary or oppressive. The Court also connected
Articles 14 (equality before law), 19 (freedoms), and 21, creating the
“golden triangle” of fundamental rights. This judgment transformed
Article 21 into a broad source of rights, including rights to privacy,
dignity, and livelihood.

3. Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015) – Section 66A of the IT Act

This case dealt with freedom of speech in the digital age. Section 66A
of the Information Technology Act, 2000, criminalized sending
“offensive” or “menacing” messages online, but the terms were vague and
broad. Several people were arrested for social media posts, leading to
public outcry.
The Supreme Court struck down Section 66A as unconstitutional, holding
it violated Article 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression). The
Court reasoned that the section was vague, overbroad, and prone to
misuse, chilling free speech. This judgment is considered a milestone in
protecting online free expression in India.

4. Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018) – Decriminalization of Homosexuality

This landmark case overturned colonial-era provisions of Section 377 of
the IPC, which criminalized “unnatural offenses” including consensual
same-sex relations. A group of petitioners, including dancer Navtej
Singh Johar, challenged the constitutional validity of Section 377.
The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, decriminalized consensual
homosexual relationships between adults. It held that criminalizing such
relations violated fundamental rights under Articles 14 (equality), 15
(non-discrimination), 19 (freedom of expression), and 21 (right to life
and personal liberty). The Court emphasized dignity, privacy, and
individual autonomy, marking a historic victory for LGBTQ+ rights in
India.
